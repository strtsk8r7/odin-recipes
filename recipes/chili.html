    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Based on everyone's reviews below, I think it's safe to say that this is an award-winning chili recipe. It has the perfect hearty texture, the best blend of spices, and it's a cinch to make. That's why it's one of my favorite one-pot meals to make when the temperature drops. Each spoonful instantly puts a smile on my face and reminds me of just how good simple comfort foods can be.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 strips thick cut bacon, sliced 1/2-inch thick</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tpsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce can) fire-roasted diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce can) black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce can) dark red kidney beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>bay leaf</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the bacon. Heat a large pot on medium heat, add the sliced bacon and cook until crispy, stirring occasionally and scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat if bacon is browning too quickly.</li>
        <li>Cook the veggies. Add the onion and bell pepper to the pot, stirring frequently. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until vegetables have softened. Add the garlic and stir for another 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Cook the beef. Add the ground beef, breaking into small pieces with a spatula, until cooked through. Strain off any accumulated liquid and fat from the pot.</li>
        <li>Add the aromatics. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Stir in the tomato paste, and dried spices, and cook until they are fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the rest and simmer. Add the canned tomatoes with juices, drained beans, beef broth, and bay leaf, and give it a stir. Increase the heat to high until the chili comes to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes uncovered, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Serve. To serve, remove bay leaf and ladle servings into individual bowls. Garnish with avocado, red onion, cheese, cilantro or other toppings (I've got ideas above).</li>
    </ol>
