    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp shortening</li>
        <li>8 tbps unsalted butter - melted</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>2 eggs - room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk - room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>cornmeal</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Add 1 tbsp of shortening to a 10" cast iron pan</p>
        <p>Preheat oven to 425&deg;F and place the pan in the oven on the center rack</p></li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the melted butter, sugar, and honey. Whisk in the eggs one at a time, beating until mixture is smooth. Add the buttermilk and mix to combine.</li>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, salt, ground cinnamon, and baking soda. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring with a spatula until only a few lumps remain. Allow the batter to sit for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the cast iron pan from the oven and pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with the spatula to create an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes, checking after 15 to make sure the top isn't browning too much. You may need to place a piece of foil over the top to prevent browning.</li>
        <li>Check with toothpick to ensure the batter is fully cooked, only a few crumbs should remain when inserted into the center. Once it's fully cooked evenly spread 1/2 tbps of unsalted butter across the top.</li>
    </ol>
